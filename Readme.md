# Tab Anywhere VSCode extension

This extension redefines the indentation behavior of the TAB key. When TAB is
pressed, the line on which the cursor is located is auto-indented, regadless
of the position of the cursor within the line. The line is indented or
unindented, depending on the previous line, and the indentation is done in one
single step.  
This extension sort of complements the  Shift + Tab command, which unindents,
regardless of the cursor position within the line.
